## Hi there üëã

I‚Äôm a passionate Future UX/UI Designer who loves to solve problems. I‚Äôm driven by the desire to understand user behaviour and needs and create solutions that enhance usability, accessibility and user experience. My previous career as a Graphic Designer has equipped me with a strong visual eye and working life skills. Taking responsibility and managing projects effectively come naturally to me. Having a curious mind and being interested in things always lead me to explore, ideate and develop. Doing my work well and customer satisfaction have always been a matter of honour for me. I have received positive feedback for my dedication to quality and customer service, which has led to long-lasting client relationships.

My educational journey at Tampere University reflects my deep commitment to UX/UI design, usability, accessibility, and web technologies. I have tailored my studies around these interests. My bachelor‚Äôs thesis focused on accessibility and web development, allowing me to justify design decisions based on WCAG standards. Additionally, my nearly completed studies in Computing Sciences and Human-Technology Interaction have equipped me with a deep understanding of user-centred design principles. My master‚Äôs thesis, ‚ÄúThe Suitability of Digital Assistive Technologies for Maintaining the Independence of Individuals with Dementia‚Äù, includes a comprehensive literature review and a user study with data analysis, showcasing my ability to conduct thorough research and apply findings to real-world problems.
